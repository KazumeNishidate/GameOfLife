This code simulates the Game of Life using GSL and EGGX. 
To compile the code, type 'make' in the program directory.
The directory 'initiconf' contains the EGGX program, which 
supports the creation of an initial configuration using the mouse. 
Also, the directory 'initconf2' contains a Perl script, which 
translates the map of a 'life' registered in the 'Life Lexicon'[1]
into a readable format and can be used as an initial configuration 
of the Game of Life.
