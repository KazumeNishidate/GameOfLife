This code simulates the Game of Life using GSL and EGGX.
Type 'make' in the program directory to compile the code.

The directory 'initiconf' contains EGGX program which supports the
creation of initial configuration using the mouse. Also the directory
'initconf2' contains Perl script which translates the map of a 'life'
registered in the 'Life Lexicon'[1] into a readable
format and can be used as an initial configuration of the Game of
Life.
